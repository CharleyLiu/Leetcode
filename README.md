# Leetcode
Collection of my Leetcode Answer

I will store my Leetcode answer here. All of them are AC answers, and I will optimaze the algrithom to make it as fast as I can.

The percentage of speed usually will underestimate the speed of this algrithom, because the OJ sometimes runs slowly, and some programmer use some ticky ways independent from the algrithom to speed their program up, like "std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); std::cin.tie(NULL);".

Anyway, I am just at the starting point now.

Hope I can do it everyday!
