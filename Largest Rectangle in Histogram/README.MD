Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

 


Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

 


The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

 

Example:

Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
